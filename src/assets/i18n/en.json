  "aboutMe": "Greetings! I'm Andriy, and I'm from Ukraine. I specialize in website layout and development. I have over a year of experience working with Angular. My skills include Angular, Ionic, HTML, CSS, TypeScript, JavaScript, and Figma. I also have experience with GSAP (for animations, if needed). I know how to find solutions to various problems that I encounter during work. Artificial intelligence helps me with this. I'm eager to work, learn, and enhance my skills. I have experience working on commercial projects. I am currently studying at CHNU and am interested in remote work or opportunities in Chernivtsi. Feel free to contact me on Telegram if needed.",
